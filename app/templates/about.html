	<h1> About </h1>
<p>According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, “Forty percent of food in the United States is never eaten, amounting to $165 billion a year in waste, taking a toll on the country's water resources and significantly increasing greenhouse gas emissions”. Food, labor, space and other resources goes wasted at an alarming rate in America and there has to be a mindset change. Restaurants and supermarkets usually have to get rid of their food by the end of the day which adds to the waste every day. In a perfect world, the food that is being wasted would go directly to the people who need it the most. Straight from the restaurants and supermarkets that have perfectly good food that has to be thrown away. <br>
    However, we understand that restaurants and supermarkets are not nonprofits and many even fear donating the food to local food pantries and shelters because of legal action against them. That being said, the fear is unfounded. According to the Food Donation Connection, “The Federal Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act protects the donor and the recipient agency against liability, excepting only gross negligence and/or intentional misconduct. In addition, each state has passed Good Samaritan Laws that provide liability protection to good faith donors. Each of the Harvest Programs we coordinate have established procedures to ensure that safe food handling and storage is built into their donation program”. However, that still leaves the responsibility of transmission of food to pantries and shelters on the restaurants and supermarkets. We aim to bridge that gap by relocating the resources of food budgets from food pantries, and shelters and instead paying Lyft drivers to deliver the food from a restaurant or supermarket to the food pantries and shelters. If we work together, we could make positive strides towards lowering our food waste in America and helping those who need it the most.
